I've been wasting so much time
Just tryna find my way back home
Now I'm losin' so much friends
They all pretend like I don't know
They wanna use you, tyhen they accuse you
When you in the wrong, when you're not
I'll make a difference, I go the distance, giving it all that I got
Should I try to lift my head?
Do I try to save my strength?
Do I dare to waste my breath?
Would you care to feel my pain?
Will I have a second chance?
Do I get to try again?
We don't have enough time left
But I'm gonna do the best I can
